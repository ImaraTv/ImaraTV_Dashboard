# Dear {{ $email }},

Thank you for registering with Imara TV Newsletter, your go-to destination for impactful and inspiring
content.

Imara TV educates the public through short, entertaining films made by young, self-employed
Kenyans using their talents in acting and animation. These films tackle important social themes
and are offered free to viewers. Imara TV emerged from the I-AM co-creation hackathon by the
UNFPA, Kenyaâ€™s Ministry of Health, UK Aid, and Nailab Accelerator to expand access to
youth-friendly information and services.

Our mission is to address issues like HIV and teenage pregnancy by creating jobs for young
people and providing engaging, relatable edutainment that inspires positive change.

Stay connected with us on social media for news, updates, and behind-the-scenes content.

Thank you for being a part of our community. We look forward to bringing you meaningful content!
